# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-06-07

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- **Status:** in_progress
- **Started:** 2026-06-07
- Actions taken:
  - Loaded caveman-mode instructions because user requested global caveman mode.
  - Loaded planning-with-files workflow because task is complex.
  - Loaded brainstorming, writing-plans, TDD, and git-worktree workflows relevant to design and implementation.
  - Checked project root.
  - Found project is effectively empty except `.codex-local`.
  - Checked Git status and log; both failed because project is not a Git repository.
  - Created persistent planning files.
  - Read official FreeRTOS documentation overview, source organization notes, kernel repository page, and reference manual structure.
  - Determined full request must be decomposed into releases before implementation.
  - User selected option C: broad FreeRTOS-like functionality.
  - Updated planning files to reflect C scope.
  - Assumed provisional platform: STM32 Cortex-M4/M7 + ARM GCC/CMake + TI C2000-style DSP abstraction.
  - Created C-scope architecture design draft.
  - Added requirement traceability matrix.
  - Added coupling test matrix.
  - Linked verification matrices from the design draft.
  - Added API catalog design.
  - Added test suite plan.
  - User approved the design.
  - Initialized Git repository.
  - Added `.gitignore`.
  - Renamed design draft to approved design file.
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md` created.
  - `findings.md` created and updated with FreeRTOS reference findings.
  - `progress.md` created.
  - `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-07-myrtos-c-scope-design.md` created.
  - `docs/verification/requirements_traceability_matrix.md` created.
  - `docs/verification/coupling_test_matrix.md` created.
  - `docs/api/myrtos_api_catalog.md` created.
  - `docs/verification/test_suite_plan.md` created.
  - `.gitignore` created.

## Test Results
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Repository detection | `git status --short --branch` | Git status or clear failure | `fatal: not a git repository` | Logged |
| Repository history detection | `git log --oneline -5` | Git log or clear failure | `fatal: not a git repository` | Logged |

## Error Log
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-06-07 | `git status` failed: not a Git repository | 1 | Logged state; continue without worktree. |
| 2026-06-07 | `git log` failed: not a Git repository | 1 | Logged state; continue without commit history. |
| 2026-06-07 | PowerShell rejected `&&` command separator | 1 | Switched to separate git commands. |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery |
| Where am I going? | Architecture spec, implementation plan, TDD implementation, docs, verification |
| What's the goal? | Build original STM32/DSP-capable RTOS with detailed Chinese comments, manual, and tests |
| What have I learned? | Project empty, not Git repo, scope needs staged design |
| What have I done? | Loaded workflows, inspected project, created planning files |
